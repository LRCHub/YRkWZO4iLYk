Sorry, I couldn't make you fall in love
Sorry, I couldn't make you fall in love

Clip my wings,
Slap my face
Eat your words
Mine are tasteless
They were kissed by your razors

Bloodshot eyes
Open wide
My pillow cries, herself to sleep
I'm so afraid to breath.

For all I am, and I'll never be
I'm a feeble excuse for your apology
Sorry, I couldn't make you fall in love
Fall in love with me.
I know I wasn't good enough,
I know wasn't good enough, enough to love
Good enough to...
Oh, Thank you, but who needs another love song

Spit me out
Piece by piece
Leave the scraps
To the hand that feeds me
Let me choke on my own dreams

For all I am, and I'll never be
I'm a feeble excuse for an apology
Sorry I couldn't make you fall in love
In love with me.
I know I wasn't good enough
I know wasn't good enough, enough to love
Oh good enough to...
Thank you, but who needs another love song

Middle 8

Snow white drank wet dreams
Juliet was such a size queen
Cinderella rock-a-fella
Slashed to her arms, to feel better
Where's prince charming... hello
No happy ending

For all I am, and I'll never be
I'm a feeble excuse for an apology
Sorry I couldn't make you fall in love, in love with me.
I know I wasn't good enough
I know wasn't good enough, enough to love
Good enough to love.
Thank you, but who needs another love song

I GUESS YOU DO!

Vamp chant

Clip my wings,
Eat your words
Slap my face
Drown the hurt
Dry me dry
Piece by piece
Leave the scraps
Choke my dreams
